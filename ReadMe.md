A standalone library that allows easy parsing and writing of OPML formatted files.

# Usage

This library comes batteries-included. You can invoke the the application and pass a path to an OPML file, which it will then clean up and print statistics about to the console;

```shell
./amper run /some/path/to/an/opml/file
```

# Bugs and Issues

If you encounter an (somewhat valid) OPML file that this lib fails to process but you think it should anyway, please don't hesitate to file an issue.
